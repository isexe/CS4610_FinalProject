Need to add tags to different object.
	Hero and enemies should be tagged and layered.
		Layer should be applied to children while tag isn't.
	Projectile should be done already.

Projectile needs fixed
	Shader is wrong
		Should be ProtoTools > UnlitAlpha
		Is Unlit > Transparent
	Needs the Bounds Check Script
		keepOnScreen = false
		radius = -1

	After fix change projectile to prefab
